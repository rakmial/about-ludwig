        <p>On a rainy Yakima evening, under a Kroger dumpster, a star was born</p>
        <p><em>He was born with no name and uncertain parentage.</em></p>

        <h1>He rises from the gutter</h1>
        <p>
            Having spent his early life pouncing on little mice around the Kroger dumpster,
            our nameless hero decided to move out of his parents' abode. There, in the driving rains,
            would he find <b>his destiny.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
            He faced many trials:
            <ul>
                <li>Cars</li>
                <li>Raccoons</li>
                <li>Ear Mites</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            His triumphs numbered in the dozens before his second birthday, when he met a kind
            stranger that lured him into a cage with Temptations and catnip. <em>His life would forever change</em>
        </p>
        <h1>He is named</h1>
        <p>
            His patron dubs him Enzo, presumably after the father of Ferrari because of his speed and style. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Enzo's life changed overnight. No longer was he required to pounce upon morsels, but these
            hairless, teetering bulbs of dread and dream served his every whim. Oh, and a few other things.
            <ol>
                <li>The plague of earmites and fleas were banished</li>
                <li>He is made a eunuch</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
